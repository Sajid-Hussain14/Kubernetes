# Containers and Containerization
I hope you are familiar with Virtual Machines and virtualization

The overall goal is to use resources efficiently.

Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that allow software to run consistently across different computing environments. They package an application and all of its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into a single unit, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy software.
A container is essentially a virtualized environment, but unlike virtual machines (VMs), containers do not require a full operating system (OS) to run. Instead, they share the OS kernel of the host machine, which makes them more lightweight and faster to start compared to VMs.

Containerization is the process of encapsulating an application and its dependencies in a container. It involves using container technologies (such as Docker) to package applications, ensuring that the application behaves consistently regardless of where it is deployed.

In containerization, the environment in which the application runs is isolated from the host system and other containers. This allows for a consistent execution environment across different systems.
